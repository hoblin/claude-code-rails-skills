# ⚠️ This Repository Has Moved

These skills have been migrated to the **Claude Ruby Marketplace** for proper plugin installation and version management.

## New Installation

```bash
# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add hoblin/claude-ruby-marketplace

# Install individual skills as plugins
/plugin install rspec@claude-ruby-marketplace
/plugin install activerecord@claude-ruby-marketplace
/plugin install draper@claude-ruby-marketplace
/plugin install mcp@claude-ruby-marketplace
```

## New Repository

**https://github.com/hoblin/claude-ruby-marketplace**

## Why the Move?

The new marketplace approach provides:
- Proper plugin installation via `/plugin install`
- Version tracking and updates via `/plugin marketplace update`
- Install only what you need (individual plugins vs entire repo)
- LSP integration support (ruby-lsp plugin)
